# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created a web-based study guide as I am beginning my learning adventure into the world of coding.
I've wanted to learn various coding languages ever since I first interacted with a computer as a kid.
Over the years I've always greatly appreciated the GUI interfaces that make life easy, but I wanted to know what was under the hood that made them work!

I built this project to provide myself a starting point for diving into a foundational understanding of this world.
My itch is lessening with each lesson learned, and I'm looking forward to what's to come.
I learned some of the basics of HTML, CSS, working with GitHub, and JavaScript as well.  And that's the truthy.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide is intended to be a source of information from all the things I have learned thus far in the program.
Each section contains notes from my learnings.  Currently there are sections on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  

JavaScript can be viewed from the DevTools console.  It is setup to choose a topic at random, or which to study first.
